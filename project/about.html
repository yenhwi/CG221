<h4> According to CDC (central of disease control and prevation) More than one-third (36.5%) of U.S. adults have obesity.
Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death.

<h2>Most Americans Still Don't Eat Their Fruits & Veggies</h2>
  <h4> 87 percent of Americans don't meet recommendations for fruit consumption, and 91 percent don't meet recommendations for vegetable consumption, according to a new U.S. report.
Researchers analyzed a 2013 survey of more than 373,000 American adults in all 50 states who answered questions about how much fruit and vegetables they eat. U.S. federal dietary guidelines recommend that
people eat between 1.5 and 2 cups of fruit per day, and 2 to 3 cups of vegetables per day.
