        <h4>Jongmin worked as a senior interactive developer and designer for over five years in South Korea. During that time, he successfully worked on projects for celebrated clients such as Samsung, SK and LG. At Firstborn Multimedia in New York, Jongmin was a Senior Developer worked on Pepsi, Sony and Cadillac. He has received multiple awards, including the Red Dot award, the IF award, the W3 award, the FWA, the Webby awards, the One Show award and the Cannes Lion award.
 
He always tries to “pursue a minus design rather than plus designs” and keeps in mind that “form follows function”, and interesting animation, interaction and minimal design. His personal works reflect his approach to design.
